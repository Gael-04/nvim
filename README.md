# nvim
My NeoVim configuration, with Lazy Vim, LSP support and more.

## Starting page
Alpha is used for a fancy hub when the editor is opened, with some shortcuts for a fast start.

## Package manager
This configuration uses Lazy VIm as package manager, with a modular and easy to customize file struct.

## LSP support
Language Server Protocol support is done with Mason and Telescope for a better looking and easy to use UI.

Autocompletion, suggestions, code actions and formatting are some of the features of this setup.

## Fuzzy finder and file manager
Telescope is used for fuzzy finding files and text in files, and Neotree is used as file manager.

## Other features
This NeoVim setup also features a built-in terminal emulator, buffer bar with Bufferline, Lualine as status bar, and more.
